Create a summary for the PR using the provided git diff and Jira ticket information.
Be as concise as possible.
Assume the reviewer is familiar with the codebase and does not need to be
explained basic concepts like what language the functions are written in and will understand
acronyms like SAM without a full explanation.  There is also no need to give AWS services
their full name.  For example, say lambda instead of aws lambda.
Do not describe changes to insignificant files like the requirements.txt, 
except in extreme cases where something seems wrong.
Include in your response a section dedicated to listing parts of the PR which likely
demand the most review and have the most potential to be incorrect or cause a security 
vulnerability.
Format your response in Markdown.
Include two sections: Key Changes and Areas for Review.
Include a one-line summary at the top.
