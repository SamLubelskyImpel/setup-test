  description: "All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will be redirected to HTTPS.
  This API allows Impel DA (Sales AI/Chat AI) to interact with the shared CRM layer, enabling actions such as posting or updating new leads, retrieving lead details, updating consumer infor  mation, and adding new activities.\n\n**Glossary:**\n1. 
    Impel CRM Layer: A unified persistence data layer designed for integration with all CRM partners. This layer aggregates all leads and activities from every CRM partner into one central repository.\n2. 
    Lead: A sales opportunity that a dealership can pursue. Every lead contains information about the consumer, a vehicle of interest, sales team information and other details.\n3.
    Consumer: A person who may be interested in buying a specific vehicle(s). The Consumer stores the personal information and preferences of its subject. A Consumer may be referenced in one or more Leads.\n4.
    Salesperson: An individual representing the dealership, responsible for managing and converting leads into sales. Each lead is typically associated with a designated salesperson who oversees the sales process for that specific lead.\n5.
    Activity: Actions, interactions, or events associated with a lead. Activities provide insights into the progress and status of a lead and can include notes, appointments, outbound calls, etc."
